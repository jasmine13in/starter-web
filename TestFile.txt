Restaurants and businesses have special deals and freebies for Mother's Day, National Teacher Appreciation Day, National Nurses Week and Memorial Day.

There's also plenty of savings for the rest of us with Cinco de Mayo at the start of the month and National Burger Day May 28.

Here are some of the big days for free food and discounts along with ongoing specials, available at participating locations. To be on the safe side, always check with your closest location before heading out. Also, some will require you to have a restaurant's app or be signed up for emails.
